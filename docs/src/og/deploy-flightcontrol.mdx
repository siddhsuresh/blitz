#### Flightcontrol makes it extremely simple to deploy anything directly to AWS. But rest assured, it handles ALL the AWS setup and management for you.

The benefit of this approach vs something like Heroku is that you now have
full ownership over everything. So should the need arise, you can pop the
hood to inspect and tweak anything.

You also get higher security and scalability by using AWS without a
platform abstraction getting in the way.

#### Setup Steps

1. [Create a Flighcontrol account](https://flightcontrol.dev?ref=blitzjs)
2. Start by selecting your repo on
   [flightcontrol.dev/projects/new/1](https://app.flightcontrol.dev/projects/new/1)
